# Cleaning Data Project

## How program works...

Read in the training and test data and merge into one file
Add the column headings

Load in the Activity data for the observations and merge into one file, title Activity
Convert the activity to a description from a number

Extract the relevant columns from the variables (mean and standard deviations)

Tidy up the column headings using Time, Frequency, Mean and StdDev

Load in the subject data for the observations and merge into one file, title Subject

Summarise column means by Subject and Activity and export as a text files

## Code Book

Note all measurements are the mean of the measurements by subject and activity

 Subject - id of subject taking test
 Activity - Activity taking place (LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS)
